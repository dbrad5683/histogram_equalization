# histogram_equalization

Compile with make.

Run with ./histogram_equalization image.jpg. Specify any JPEG file. Produces out.jpg.
  
If libjpeg is not available, comment out everything in main and call test() instead. This generates random data and outputs it into result.bin. Using MATLAB, run histogram_equalization.m from the same directory as result.bin to view the output.  
  
Sample images and outputs are included in the images directory. NOTE: The only 8K UHD sample image is winter.jpg
